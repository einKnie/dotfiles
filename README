The whole setup can be installed with the install.sh script.
The script will install required programs and symlink the
files in HOME/ to their respective place in your $HOME.
Check the scripts parameters with `-h` beforehand to perform
an informed install.

Files in ROOT/ may be installed manually if needed.
Copy to the respective location in your / and set the correct permissions.
Note: These are very specific to one system or use case, and will need
adaptations for other setups.
